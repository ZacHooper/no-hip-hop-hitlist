# No Hip-Hip Hitlist Spotify Playlist

A playlist that contains the Triple J hitlist without any hip-hop music. 

Now no disrespect to any of the Hip-Hop artists I just personally am often not the biggest fan of the genre. I do however, like finding new music and the Triple J Hitlist is a great way to do that. So in a bid to make the playlist more enjoyable for me to use I've duplicated it with this no-hip-hop-hitlist where I strip out all the hip-hop music.
